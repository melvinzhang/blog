some goals for blogging. Having only one week to write made me think hard about
the topics I wanted to cover in the limited time.  I contributed a total of
five posts, which you can find &lt;a href="http://nusschoolofcomputing.blogspot.com/search/label/Melvin%20Zhang"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The ability to write well is critical to doing research, because the best ideas

background information and motivation to the reader so that he/she can
appreciate its usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="writing"></category></entry></feed>
