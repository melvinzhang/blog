You send an email to &lt;a href="mailto:post@posterous.com"&gt;post@posterous.com&lt;/a&gt; and your blog post get created automatically from the content of the mail. This has the benefit of using a mature system to write and send messages (aka email) instead of a clunky web interface. Another benefit of using email, that I discovered recently in Shanghai, is that I can still create posts even though Posterous is blocked (ironically WordPress has been unblocked).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Loving You</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/loving-you" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-16T05:10:20+08:00</published><updated>2010-07-16T05:10:20+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2010-07-16:/loving-you</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;

language as (x,y) and (x,y,z) respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I wanted to create a simple illustration for a programming task on stacks. Using Asymptote, I created the following image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2009/04/02/asymptote-a-language-for-vector-graphics/11636347-media_httpmelvinzhang_uJgwh.png" width="480"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A structured image is similar to a structured program because it can be
decomposed into simpler elements that are repeated with slight differences,
analogous to the way functions are called with different parameters. In my
illustration, the basic component is a labeled box, i.e. a square with a label.
Several boxes are arranged vertically to form a stack. Three stacks are
arranged side-by-side to illustrate the given input and expected output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymptote code of the above illustration is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;picture labelbox(string s, pair corner, int width=1, int height=1) {
    picture pict;
    path box = corner--(corner.x+width,corner.y)--
                   (corner.x+width,corner.y+height)--
                   (corner.x,corner.y+height)--cycle;
    draw(pict, box);
    label(pict, s, corner, NE);
    return pict;
}

picture stack(string s, int[] v = {}) {
    picture pict;
    label(pict, s, (0.5,0), S);
    draw(pict, (0,0)--(1,0));
    for (int i = 0; i &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My trip to Paris for the RECOMB Comparative Genomics workshop is coming to an
end. It has been a great week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/RCG08/"&gt;RECOMB Comparative Genomics Workshop&lt;/a&gt; was
held from Monday to Wednesday. My talk was on the second day, it went smoothly
but ended a little early. There was only one question, but after the talk a
couple of people came and gave me some suggestions. On the same day as my talk,
there was a dinner cruise on the river Seine and I got to meet some other folks
during the dinner. All in all, it was a great conference as the topics
discussed are closely related to my own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem I encountered was being unable to use my N82 to take
pictures. Meddling with the settings and doing a reset did not help, in the end
I had to buy 2 disposable cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference ended on Wednesday, I visited Le Panthéon. The most
interesting part is the underground crypt, which houses the remains of
distinguished citizens of France, including Marie Curie. Given the number of
CRPG games with crypt levels, I was half expecting skeletons and zombies to
jump out at me. After that, I went to Jardin du Luxembourg, the largest park in
Paris. It was a refreshing change from the concrete jungle of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of Thursday was spent visiting Prof Frej Tekaia. We had a
good discussion on some research problems of mutual interest. After that, I
went to see the Eiffel Tower, it looks a lot bigger up close as compared to
when I saw it from afar during the dinner cruise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally on Friday, I visited the Louvre Museum and saw the Mona Lisa, among
many other sculptors and paintings. Personally, I don't quite understand why
the Mona Lisa is so famous. The last place I visited was the La Grande Galerie
de l'Evolution (roughly translated as Grand Gallery of Evolution),I found it
more fascinating than the Louvre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, the pictures from the disposable camera can be developed. Then
I'll scan them and add them to this post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>IOI 2008 is over</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/ioi-2008-is-over" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-08-24T14:37:54+08:00</published><updated>2008-08-24T14:37:54+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2008-08-24:/ioi-2008-is-over</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;IOI has finally ended but the Singapore team is staying one additional day

using this time to update my blog but unfortunately I left my micro USB cable

&lt;p&gt;This year, the contestants won 1 silver and 3 bronze medals, which is an improvement over the 1 silver and 2 bronze medals from last year. More importantly, everyone got a medal. Singapore has taken part in IOI since 1992 and the only other years which we achieved this was in 1997 (1S 3B) and 2001 (2G 2S). A detailed listing of our achievements in IOI is available from the NOI website, &lt;a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Enoi/infonoi.html"&gt;http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~noi/infonoi.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth year I am attending IOI and it is really a nice feeling
seeing the familiar faces from the various country delegations. During some of
our discussions, we toyed around with the idea of hosting IOI in Singapore by
2015. My dream of hosting an ACM ICPC regional in Singapore was realized in
December 2007, perhaps one day we will also host the IOI.&lt;/p&gt;

implement some new ideas. It is amazing how much information you need to keep
in your head to even start working on a modification of existing code. It took
me a while to get used to the code again, thankfully I had written some simple
comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the point of writing the program, writing comments seems like a waste of
time because all the information is already at your fingertips, but if you try
to work on the program again after a while, you will find the comments
invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
