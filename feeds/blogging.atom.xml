You send an email to &lt;a href="mailto:post@posterous.com"&gt;post@posterous.com&lt;/a&gt; and your blog post get created automatically from the content of the mail. This has the benefit of using a mature system to write and send messages (aka email) instead of a clunky web interface. Another benefit of using email, that I discovered recently in Shanghai, is that I can still create posts even though Posterous is blocked (ironically WordPress has been unblocked).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blogging"></category></entry><entry><title>First post on Posterous!</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/first-post-on-posterous" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-09T12:47:10+08:00</published><updated>2010-07-09T12:47:10+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2010-07-09:/first-post-on-posterous</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm using this service as a one stop site for publishing on the web.

idea of posting via email appeals to me because it can be easily automated
using command line tools. More about that later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blogging"></category></entry></feed>
