It was a very simple web site written by hand using HTML and CSS. The purpose was to learn HTML but it also served as a page which I would put up mini reviews of freeware games/applications. The main page also contains a number of dated entries to indicate when the site was updated and some snippets of what I was doing in real life. The last entry which was dated August 9, 2000 was posted on National Day, see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next period in my web authoring experience was when I entered NUS in 2002. All SoC students are given a web site at &lt;a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Eunix_user_name"&gt;http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~unix_user_name&lt;/a&gt;. It was far easier to setup a webpage than on my previous hosted service as I could upload the files to the server directly. I mainly used it to host a number of files, such as presentation slides etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, I started a server for ACM/IOI training. The server hosted the Mooshak contest management system and a DokuWiki based website for the ACM/IOI community in NUS. The site grew over the years and over time I starting using the site to document my HYP project and to create web pages for courses I was teaching. After a while, the server began to show signs of instability. Intending to avoid the hassle of managing a physical server, I requested for a Solaris Zone account from the school, which is now the hosting the current algorithmics.comp.nus.edu.sg site.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="web"></category></entry></feed>
