I've decided to migrate to &lt;a href="http://octopress.org"&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; as it generates a
set of static files, currently hosted on GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of using my own domain is that I'm able to preserve any
existing links that point to the old Posterous hosted site. Migration from
Posterous to Octopress is a lot easier than I expected by following the

&lt;p&gt;Many of the mechanical procedures we learned in primary and secondary school for calculating the result of certain mathematical operations are really just numerical algorithms. Usually we start with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_arithmetic#Addition_algorithm"&gt;Addition algorithm&lt;/a&gt; for finding the sum of two numbers, this is typically followed by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_arithmetic#Multiplication"&gt;Multiplication algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the Addition algorithm and digit shifting. Often we are just taught the steps, but not the reason why following them will give us the correct answer (correctness) or how the steps were developed in the first place (design).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem posted by Chris Henry on the &lt;a href="http://nusschoolofcomputing.blogspot.com/2008/10/noi-01-task-1_07.html"&gt;frequency of the mode&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of a similar problem, that of finding the majority in a collection of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; items. The majority is the item whose frequency is more than &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n/2\)&lt;/span&gt;. This problem has a very clever but simple &lt;a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%C2%A0moore/best-ideas/mjrty/index.html"&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; that only needs only one pass over the data. It was listed by one of its inventors, &lt;a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%C2%A0moore/"&gt;J Stother Moore&lt;/a&gt;, as one of his best ideas. It is also my favorite algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

on 10/01/09.&lt;p&gt;Taking notes is an important part of learning something new. I
find it extremely useful to jot down the important points while the material is
still fresh in your head. I’ve experimented with a number of different note
taking mediums in the past and I hope to share with you some of my
insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper notes are easy to write (unless you have a bad handwriting, like me) and
draw diagrams. However, organizing the notes afterwards can be a pain. This
method works fairly well for module notes as you will usually read them in a
sequential fashion and the notes can be written next to the slides. If I’m
doing a module summary, which is longer, I will type out the notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you might need to do some quick research to solve a small problem,
such as figuring out how to configure your smart phone to access the wifi
network. After finding the answer on the web, I find it useful to type out a
short howto to remind myself how is it done, in case I need to do it again in
the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with the above methods is that notes are largely independent of
one another and it is difficult to find all the information about a particular
topic which may be stored in different files/pieces of paper. A more useful
note taking system should allow one to create hyperlinks between different
notes and to easily search for specific pieces of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2009/12/23/using-a-personal-wiki-for-notes-and-todos/11636311-media_httplh5ggphtcom_ggsum.jpg" title="A screenshot of TiddlyWiki from WikiMatrix.org" alt="A screenshot of TiddlyWiki from WikiMatrix.org"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution, as you might have guessed from the title, is to use a wiki
engine. Unfortunately, most wiki software require a web server and database
backend, which is too complicated for me. Realizing the need for a lightweight,
portable wiki for personal use, Jeremy Ruston built
&lt;a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/"&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt;, which is a single HTML file powered
by JavaScript. The one I’m using for notes is a derivative known as
&lt;a href="http://mptw.tiddlyspot.com/"&gt;MPTW&lt;/a&gt;, it has a cousin
&lt;a href="http://monkeygtd.tiddlyspot.com/"&gt;MonkeyGTD&lt;/a&gt; which I use for managing projects
and todos. You simply store the file on your local machine and open it in a
browser. When you save your changes, the JavaScript writes the changes back to
the file.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notes"></category></entry><entry><title>Data driven programming assignments</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/data-driven-programming-assignments" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-23T09:48:06+08:00</published><updated>2009-12-23T09:48:06+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2009-12-23:/data-driven-programming-assignments</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Originally appeared

&lt;a href="https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/%C2%A0cmsem/seminar_files/9655.txt"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%C2%A0bryant/"&gt;Randall Bryant&lt;/a&gt; on Data Intensive Scalable
Computing. His focus was on computer systems for processing large amounts of
data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized the importance of data driven computations earlier though my
experience setting programming assignments. I think it is important to have
problems that are realistic; where you want to write the programs in order to
see the results. Unfortunately, most of the time we are technique driven. We
try to form a task around a specific method. However, most problems usually
have a rather trivial solution, therefore we need to impose some unreasonable
constraints or increase the size of the problem to some unbelievably large size
in order to force the use of specific techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the correct approach is to start from the data. There are large amount
of interesting data that is available over the web, from
&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces"&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt; to
&lt;a href="http://www.tagora-project.eu/data/"&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt;. In the UNIX workshop I conducted
for freshmen orientation 2008, I made use of the &lt;a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%C2%A0rpnlpir/downloads/corpora/smsCorpus/"&gt;SMS corpus&lt;/a&gt;
from the &lt;a href="http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/portal/"&gt;WING&lt;/a&gt; research group to
motivate the use of UNIX pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with large amounts of publicly available real world data gives rise to
realistic computational problems where the effect of efficient algorithms
become apparent. Computations that takes hours to run using a naive method can
be completed in seconds using the correct approach. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="teaching"></category></entry><entry><title>From Research to Teaching and Outreach</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/from-research-to-teaching-and-outreach" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-23T09:42:13+08:00</published><updated>2009-12-23T09:42:13+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2009-12-23:/from-research-to-teaching-and-outreach</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Originally appeared

&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I talked about research in CS, one of the goals of research
is to advance our understanding in a specific area. IMHO, there are at least

&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I talked about research in CS, one of the goals of research
is to advance our understanding in a specific area. IMHO, there are at least
three different "frontiers" of understanding: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expertise of other researchers/practitioner in the area (the usual sense of research)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;level of understanding attained by undergraduates in the area (teaching)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public or layman understanding/appreciation of the area (outreach)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both teaching and outreach are important to the development of a field because
it expands the talent pool and imparts modes of thinking that are peculiar to
the area. In recent years, there is push to promote &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%C2%A0CompThink/"&gt;Computational
Thinking&lt;/a&gt; as a fundamental skill, on
equal terms with reading, writing, and arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve helped out at the NUS SoC open house booth for the last two years, and a
recurring problem is that most folks have no clue as to what we do in
Computing. I think the Europeans got it right when they used the term
“Informatics” instead of “Computer Science”. As
&lt;a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/"&gt;Dijkstra&lt;/a&gt; wrote in
&lt;a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD682.html"&gt;EWD682&lt;/a&gt;,
“we don’t call painting ‘brush art’, nor surgery ‘knife science’ ”.
Incidentally, Dijkstra is probably one of the earliest bloggers, he started to
send his writings to colleagues by regular mail, before the advent of the
Internet. Now, you can view his writings at the &lt;a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/"&gt;EWD
Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the term “Information Engineering”, which puts the emphasis on the
object of our study, information, and away from the tool we use, the computer.
Most people tend to have a better sense of what is engineering, it is about
building useful things. In computing, we design algorithms and build software
to manage/process information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have some simple way to describe what we do in Computing to the layman?

my alma mater, Swiss Cottage Secondary School. I offered to talk about careers
in IT but was told that it was already taken. I suggested maybe I can talk
about a career in research and development instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for this talk, I’d thought I will revise a &lt;a href="http://nusschoolofcomputing.blogspot.com/2009/01/primer-on-cs-research-and-relevance-of.html"&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt;
I wrote for the &lt;a href="http://nusschoolofcomputing.blogspot.com"&gt;NUS SoC blog&lt;/a&gt;
regarding the relevance of research skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, computer science research is a systematic study of a specific
problem to derive new methods and design of computer systems to solve real
world problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us have to perform various research related activities at one point or another, whether it is working on an project or doing a literature survey for an essay we have to write. In general, a research project consists of the following components: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify and formulate the problem to be solved (IMHO, the most important step)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;review of existing work on related problems (to avoid reinventing the wheel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proposal of a new solution (not as hard as it sounds, often a refinement of an existing solutions or a combination of various other solutions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show that your proposed solution indeed solves the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all serious projects involved the above steps. That is why research
skills such as problem formulation, review of related work and design of
experiments to support your claims are important. In particular, formulating
the right problem is often the key step towards a solution. To quote the words
of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti"&gt;Jiddu Krishnamurti&lt;/a&gt;, an
Indian philosopher, “If we can really understand the problem, the answer will
come out of it, because the answer is not separate from the problem”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="research"></category></entry><entry><title>Bowling, Badminton and Buffet at Swiss Past Vs Present Games Day</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/bowling-badminton-and-buffet-at-swiss-past-vs-present-games-day" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-15T16:49:59+08:00</published><updated>2009-09-15T16:49:59+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2009-09-15:/bowling-badminton-and-buffet-at-swiss-past-vs-present-games-day</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The second annual Swiss Cottage Past vs Present Games Day was held on the 5th

September. Initially, I did not feel like attending the event as I could not
get anyone from my class to come. The day before the games day, I received an
SMS from William (one of alumni committee members from class of 75) asking all
committee members to come down and support the games. I realized I shouldn’t
avoid the event just because no one else from my class is going, I should just
go down and get to know the other alumni and current students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2009/09/15/bowling-badminton-and-buffet-at-swiss-past-vs-present-games-day/11636325-media_httpmelvinzhang_tDDut.png" title="Bowling@CDANS" alt="Bowling@CDANS"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bowling competition was held at CDANS, opposite Swiss Cottage. I was
“coerced” into joining the game and was assigned to play alongside two new
alumni. I figured they must be from Swiss Bowlers as they had their own
carrying bags and bowling balls. We played a total of three games and my scores
were: 104, 77, 83.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2009/09/15/bowling-badminton-and-buffet-at-swiss-past-vs-present-games-day/11636327-media_httpmelvinzhang_CDCAE.png" title="Badminton@Swiss Hall" alt="Badminton@Swiss Hall"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had lunch with a group of alumni at CDANS before walking back to Swiss
Cottage for the afternoon games. Due to lack of players, Annie and I joined in
the badminton game which was held in the school hall. Since both of us are not
familiar with the game, needless to say we were completely trashed by the Swiss
girls from the badminton club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of other games where held around Swiss, including basketball,
floorball and soccer. In the end, the alumni won three out of the five games
that were played that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I am glad that I decided to go down for the games day as I
really enjoyed myself playing the games. I also got to meet up with Mrs Ellie
Koh and Mr Saiffudin, two teachers from when I was at Swiss but have since
retired.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scss"></category></entry><entry><title>Blogging from the command line</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/blogging-from-the-command-line" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-04T01:00:17+08:00</published><updated>2009-04-04T01:00:17+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2009-04-04:/blogging-from-the-command-line</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is composed in the text editor &lt;a href="http://www.vim.org"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;a href="http://www.latex-project.org/"&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; format and converted to HTML using &lt;a href="http://hevea.inria.fr/"&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;.

language as (x,y) and (x,y,z) respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I wanted to create a simple illustration for a programming task on stacks. Using Asymptote, I created the following image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2009/04/02/asymptote-a-language-for-vector-graphics/11636347-media_httpmelvinzhang_uJgwh.png" width="480"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A structured image is similar to a structured program because it can be
decomposed into simpler elements that are repeated with slight differences,
analogous to the way functions are called with different parameters. In my
illustration, the basic component is a labeled box, i.e. a square with a label.
Several boxes are arranged vertically to form a stack. Three stacks are
arranged side-by-side to illustrate the given input and expected output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymptote code of the above illustration is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;picture labelbox(string s, pair corner, int width=1, int height=1) {
    picture pict;

                   (corner.x,corner.y+height)--cycle;
    draw(pict, box);
    label(pict, s, corner, NE);
    return pict;
}

picture stack(string s, int[] v = {}) {

&lt;p&gt;My trip to Paris for the RECOMB Comparative Genomics workshop is coming to an
end. It has been a great week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/RCG08/"&gt;RECOMB Comparative Genomics Workshop&lt;/a&gt; was
held from Monday to Wednesday. My talk was on the second day, it went smoothly
but ended a little early. There was only one question, but after the talk a
couple of people came and gave me some suggestions. On the same day as my talk,
there was a dinner cruise on the river Seine and I got to meet some other folks
during the dinner. All in all, it was a great conference as the topics
discussed are closely related to my own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem I encountered was being unable to use my N82 to take
pictures. Meddling with the settings and doing a reset did not help, in the end
I had to buy 2 disposable cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference ended on Wednesday, I visited Le Panthéon. The most
interesting part is the underground crypt, which houses the remains of
distinguished citizens of France, including Marie Curie. Given the number of
CRPG games with crypt levels, I was half expecting skeletons and zombies to
jump out at me. After that, I went to Jardin du Luxembourg, the largest park in
Paris. It was a refreshing change from the concrete jungle of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of Thursday was spent visiting Prof Frej Tekaia. We had a
good discussion on some research problems of mutual interest. After that, I
went to see the Eiffel Tower, it looks a lot bigger up close as compared to
when I saw it from afar during the dinner cruise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally on Friday, I visited the Louvre Museum and saw the Mona Lisa, among
many other sculptors and paintings. Personally, I don't quite understand why
the Mona Lisa is so famous. The last place I visited was the La Grande Galerie
de l'Evolution (roughly translated as Grand Gallery of Evolution),I found it
more fascinating than the Louvre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, the pictures from the disposable camera can be developed. Then
I'll scan them and add them to this post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>IOI 2008 is over</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/ioi-2008-is-over" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-08-24T14:37:54+08:00</published><updated>2008-08-24T14:37:54+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2008-08-24:/ioi-2008-is-over</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;IOI has finally ended but the Singapore team is staying one additional day

because the direct flight from Egypt to Singapore via SIA leaves on Sunday. I'm
using this time to update my blog but unfortunately I left my micro USB cable
in my room so I'm unable to upload any photos from my N82, will have to do that
after I get back to Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the contestants won 1 silver and 3 bronze medals, which is an improvement over the 1 silver and 2 bronze medals from last year. More importantly, everyone got a medal. Singapore has taken part in IOI since 1992 and the only other years which we achieved this was in 1997 (1S 3B) and 2001 (2G 2S). A detailed listing of our achievements in IOI is available from the NOI website, &lt;a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Enoi/infonoi.html"&gt;http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~noi/infonoi.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth year I am attending IOI and it is really a nice feeling
seeing the familiar faces from the various country delegations. During some of
our discussions, we toyed around with the idea of hosting IOI in Singapore by
2015. My dream of hosting an ACM ICPC regional in Singapore was realized in
December 2007, perhaps one day we will also host the IOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update 27th Aug: Photos are available &lt;a href="http://algorithmics.comp.nus.edu.sg/wiki/gallery/egypt_2008"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

implement some new ideas. It is amazing how much information you need to keep

me a while to get used to the code again, thankfully I had written some simple

time because all the information is already at your fingertips, but if you try
to work on the program again after a while, you will find the comments
invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

Computing teacher at Dunman High, whom I met during IOI 2005. It was nice to
see him again and catch up on what we've been up to in the last couple of
years. At the end of our conversation, he asked for my email address. I wrote
it on a piece of paper and jokingly added that he could have googled me for the
information. I assumed that since I have this website, it will be indexed by
Google and people who want to contact me can find my information here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I've never actually tried to google for my own info so I'm not sure
if it would actually work. To test it out, I tried the following queries in
Google today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were somewhat surprising. First of all, I was surprised to be even
on the first page of Google for “melvin” alone. The other interesting result,
was how much I'm associated with NUS. A search for “melvin nus” gave more
relevant pages as compared to a search for “melvin zhang”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone asks me what is my major, I'll say that I am part Computer Science and part Computational Biology since my undergraduate was in Computer Science while my HYP and current work is in Computational Biology. I have to confess that I'm not a real biologist and my biology knowledge is fairly limited, but I have a healthy curiosity in new developments in biology. The diversity and complexity of life has always fascinated me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational biology is the application of computational techniques for tackling problems in biology. The problems can be broadly classified into two types. The first is to assist in the design/interpretation/analysis of high throughput experiments, such as micro arrays, tandem mass spectroscopy and DNA sequencing machines. The second is to discover meaningful patterns from biological data to improve our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own work in the comparative genomics of gene order is from the second category. The data I am considering is a set of gene orders, where a gene order is the sequence of genes that makes up the genome of a species. Although many species share a large number of genes, the arrangement of these genes are different due to large scale rearrangement events (see Figure 1 above) that has the effect of shuffling the genes around.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="research"></category></entry><entry><title>Music from YouTube</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/music-from-youtube" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-10T08:26:00+08:00</published><updated>2008-02-10T08:26:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2008-02-10:/music-from-youtube</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These days I've been using YouTube as a music player.

It was a very simple web site written by hand using HTML and CSS. The purpose was to learn HTML but it also served as a page which I would put up mini reviews of freeware games/applications. The main page also contains a number of dated entries to indicate when the site was updated and some snippets of what I was doing in real life. The last entry which was dated August 9, 2000 was posted on National Day, see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next period in my web authoring experience was when I entered NUS in 2002. All SoC students are given a web site at &lt;a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Eunix_user_name"&gt;http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~unix_user_name&lt;/a&gt;. It was far easier to setup a webpage than on my previous hosted service as I could upload the files to the server directly. I mainly used it to host a number of files, such as presentation slides etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, I started a server for ACM/IOI training. The server hosted the Mooshak contest management system and a DokuWiki based website for the ACM/IOI community in NUS. The site grew over the years and over time I starting using the site to document my HYP project and to create web pages for courses I was teaching. After a while, the server began to show signs of instability. Intending to avoid the hassle of managing a physical server, I requested for a Solaris Zone account from the school, which is now the hosting the current algorithmics.comp.nus.edu.sg site.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>SRG Day 2</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/srg-day-2" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-13T02:50:00+08:00</published><updated>2008-01-13T02:50:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2008-01-13:/srg-day-2</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The three events held on the morning of the second day of the Singapore Robotic Games are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;RC Sumo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RC Sumo is almost the same as the autonomous sumo content, except that the robots are controlled by human handlers. Essentially two robots face off on a circular platform and the first robot to be pushed off the platform loses. The inclusion of the handlers makes the matches more exciting as sometimes the autonomous matches simply becomes a straight forward pushing contest. The handlers are typically less aggressive and tend to move about the platform more carefully. SRG's sumo competition is modeled after a contest in Japan, below is a video of the Japanese version.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Micromouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the micromouse competition brings back some fond memories of my secondary school days. I was in the Computer Club back then and we had a micromouse group. I was never directly involved with the micromouse teams, but watching an autonomous robot navigate a maze inspired me to think about how problem solving skills can be incorporated into a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robot Soccer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the morning for me was the Robot Soccer Competition. It consists of two competing teams with 6 small cuboid robots each. The objective was to score but pushing a ping pong ball into the opposing team's goal, must like real soccer.The actions of the robots are controlled by a separate computer which is directly connected to a video feed of the top view of the entire playing area. An interesting trick was used to solve the problem of identification and localization of the robots. Each robot has a special colored logo on its top and this is analyzed by the image processing software on the controlling computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is no doubt one of the more difficult ones, as only four teams were registered. The strengths of the teams also differs greatly, for the match I watched the final score was 10:0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Round up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't have time on Wednesday to attend the last day of the competition, but overall I felt that the SRG was a successful event in that it was able to attract a large number of teams from a variety of institutions from primary schools up to polytechnics and ITEs. Unfortunately due to the timing of the event, not many members of the public (like myself) was present. I guess only university students would be free during the period of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="robotics"></category></entry><entry><title>SRG Day 1</title><link href="https://blog.melvinzhang.net/srg-day-1" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-09T05:39:00+08:00</published><updated>2008-01-09T05:39:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Melvin Zhang</name></author><id>tag:blog.melvinzhang.net,2008-01-09:/srg-day-1</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I usually pass by the Science Center on my way to NUS.

&lt;p&gt;There are three events being held this morning, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underwater Robot Competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autonomous Sumo Robot Competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robot Colony Competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Robot Colony Competition was the most interesting for me as it involves an interesting combination of hardware and software. In this event, teams must build a pair of autonomous robots that has to collect a number of pellets (blue and green) and deposit the correct colored pellet into a designated hole. There are two collection holes (one for each color) at two opposite corners of the playing field. The playing field is black except for reflective tape at the borders and collection holes. See the YouTube video below for an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="videobox"&gt;
                    &lt;iframe width="640" height="390"
                        src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-6QIPOJrVg'

                        mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;
                    &lt;/iframe&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robot hardware needs to be able to sense the colored pellets on a black featureless platform and have an effective mechanism to separate/store/deposit the two types of pellets. The software components needs to handle localization of the robot and coordination/information sharing between the two robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to the Robot Soccer Competition tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="robotics"></category></entry></feed>
