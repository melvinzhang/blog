implement some new ideas. It is amazing how much information you need to keep
in your head to even start working on a modification of existing code. It took
me a while to get used to the code again, thankfully I had written some simple
comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the point of writing the program, writing comments seems like a waste of
time because all the information is already at your fingertips, but if you try
to work on the program again after a while, you will find the comments
invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other reasons why writing software is so difficult, see this &lt;a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/6j1mf/comments/c03zf02"&gt;Reddit comment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category></entry></feed>
