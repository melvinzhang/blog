on 10/01/09.&lt;p&gt;Taking notes is an important part of learning something new. I
find it extremely useful to jot down the important points while the material is
still fresh in your head. I’ve experimented with a number of different note
taking mediums in the past and I hope to share with you some of my
insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper notes are easy to write (unless you have a bad handwriting, like me) and
draw diagrams. However, organizing the notes afterwards can be a pain. This
method works fairly well for module notes as you will usually read them in a
sequential fashion and the notes can be written next to the slides. If I’m
doing a module summary, which is longer, I will type out the notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you might need to do some quick research to solve a small problem,
such as figuring out how to configure your smart phone to access the wifi
network. After finding the answer on the web, I find it useful to type out a
short howto to remind myself how is it done, in case I need to do it again in
the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with the above methods is that notes are largely independent of
one another and it is difficult to find all the information about a particular
topic which may be stored in different files/pieces of paper. A more useful
note taking system should allow one to create hyperlinks between different
notes and to easily search for specific pieces of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solution, as you might have guessed from the title, is to use a wiki
engine. Unfortunately, most wiki software require a web server and database
backend, which is too complicated for me. Realizing the need for a lightweight,
portable wiki for personal use, Jeremy Ruston built
&lt;a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/"&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt;, which is a single HTML file powered
by JavaScript. The one I’m using for notes is a derivative known as
&lt;a href="http://mptw.tiddlyspot.com/"&gt;MPTW&lt;/a&gt;, it has a cousin
&lt;a href="http://monkeygtd.tiddlyspot.com/"&gt;MonkeyGTD&lt;/a&gt; which I use for managing projects
and todos. You simply store the file on your local machine and open it in a
browser. When you save your changes, the JavaScript writes the changes back to
the file.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notes"></category></entry></feed>
