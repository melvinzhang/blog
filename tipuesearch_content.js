This is the last in a series of reposts from the NUS SoC blog . Many of the mechanical procedures we learned in primary and secondary school for calculating the result of certain mathematical operations are really just numerical algorithms. Usually we start with the Addition algorithm for finding the sum of two numbers, this is typically followed by the Multiplication algorithm , which uses the Addition algorithm and digit shifting. Often we are just taught the steps, but not the reason why following them will give us the correct answer (correctness) or how the steps were developed in the first place (design). The problem posted by Chris Henry on the frequency of the mode reminded me of a similar problem, that of finding the majority in a collection of \\(n\\) items. The majority is the item whose frequency is more than \\(n/2\\) . This problem has a very clever but simple solution that only needs only one pass over the data. It was listed by one of its inventors, J Stother Moore , as one of his best ideas. It is also my favorite algorithm. What is your favorite algorithm?","tags":"cs","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/my-favorite-algorithm","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/my-favorite-algorithm"},{"title":"Using a personal wiki for notes and todos","text":"Originally appeared here on 10/01/09. Taking notes is an important part of learning something new. I find it extremely useful to jot down the important points while the material is still fresh in your head. I've experimented with a number of different note taking mediums in the past and I hope to share with you some of my insights. Paper notes are easy to write (unless you have a bad handwriting, like me) and draw diagrams. However, organizing the notes afterwards can be a pain. This method works fairly well for module notes as you will usually read them in a sequential fashion and the notes can be written next to the slides. If I'm doing a module summary, which is longer, I will type out the notes. Sometimes, you might need to do some quick research to solve a small problem, such as figuring out how to configure your smart phone to access the wifi network. After finding the answer on the web, I find it useful to type out a short howto to remind myself how is it done, in case I need to do it again in the future. The trouble with the above methods is that notes are largely independent of one another and it is difficult to find all the information about a particular topic which may be stored in different files/pieces of paper. A more useful note taking system should allow one to create hyperlinks between different notes and to easily search for specific pieces of information. My solution, as you might have guessed from the title, is to use a wiki engine. Unfortunately, most wiki software require a web server and database backend, which is too complicated for me. Realizing the need for a lightweight, portable wiki for personal use, Jeremy Ruston built TiddlyWiki , which is a single HTML file powered by JavaScript. The one I'm using for notes is a derivative known as MPTW , it has a cousin MonkeyGTD which I use for managing projects and todos. You simply store the file on your local machine and open it in a browser. When you save your changes, the JavaScript writes the changes back to the file.","tags":"notes","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/using-a-personal-wiki-for-notes-and-todos","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/using-a-personal-wiki-for-notes-and-todos"},{"title":"Data driven programming assignments","text":"Originally appeared here on 09/01/09. I attended a talk by Randall Bryant on Data Intensive Scalable Computing. His focus was on computer systems for processing large amounts of data. I realized the importance of data driven computations earlier though my experience setting programming assignments. I think it is important to have problems that are realistic; where you want to write the programs in order to see the results. Unfortunately, most of the time we are technique driven. We try to form a task around a specific method. However, most problems usually have a rather trivial solution, therefore we need to impose some unreasonable constraints or increase the size of the problem to some unbelievably large size in order to force the use of specific techniques. I think the correct approach is to start from the data. There are large amount of interesting data that is available over the web, from movies to tags . In the UNIX workshop I conducted for freshmen orientation 2008, I made use of the SMS corpus from the WING research group to motivate the use of UNIX pipes. Dealing with large amounts of publicly available real world data gives rise to realistic computational problems where the effect of efficient algorithms become apparent. Computations that takes hours to run using a naive method can be completed in seconds using the correct approach.","tags":"teaching","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/data-driven-programming-assignments","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/data-driven-programming-assignments"},{"title":"From Research to Teaching and Outreach","text":"Originally appeared here on 07/01/09. In my previous post I talked about research in CS, one of the goals of research is to advance our understanding in a specific area. IMHO, there are at least three different \"frontiers\" of understanding: expertise of other researchers/practitioner in the area (the usual sense of research) level of understanding attained by undergraduates in the area (teaching) public or layman understanding/appreciation of the area (outreach) Both teaching and outreach are important to the development of a field because it expands the talent pool and imparts modes of thinking that are peculiar to the area. In recent years, there is push to promote Computational Thinking as a fundamental skill, on equal terms with reading, writing, and arithmetic. I've helped out at the NUS SoC open house booth for the last two years, and a recurring problem is that most folks have no clue as to what we do in Computing. I think the Europeans got it right when they used the term \"Informatics\" instead of \"Computer Science\". As Dijkstra wrote in EWD682 , \"we don't call painting ‚Äòbrush art', nor surgery ‚Äòknife science' \". Incidentally, Dijkstra is probably one of the earliest bloggers, he started to send his writings to colleagues by regular mail, before the advent of the Internet. Now, you can view his writings at the EWD Archive I prefer the term \"Information Engineering\", which puts the emphasis on the object of our study, information, and away from the tool we use, the computer. Most people tend to have a better sense of what is engineering, it is about building useful things. In computing, we design algorithms and build software to manage/process information. Do you have some simple way to describe what we do in Computing to the layman? Do share your ideas/suggestions in the comments.","tags":"outreach","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/from-research-to-teaching-and-outreach","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/from-research-to-teaching-and-outreach"},{"title":"Relevance of research skills","text":"I was asked to give a career talk to graduating secondary school students for my alma mater, Swiss Cottage Secondary School. I offered to talk about careers in IT but was told that it was already taken. I suggested maybe I can talk about a career in research and development instead. In preparation for this talk, I'd thought I will revise a blog post I wrote for the NUS SoC blog regarding the relevance of research skill. In a nutshell, computer science research is a systematic study of a specific problem to derive new methods and design of computer systems to solve real world problems. Most of us have to perform various research related activities at one point or another, whether it is working on an project or doing a literature survey for an essay we have to write. In general, a research project consists of the following components: identify and formulate the problem to be solved (IMHO, the most important step) review of existing work on related problems (to avoid reinventing the wheel) proposal of a new solution (not as hard as it sounds, often a refinement of an existing solutions or a combination of various other solutions) show that your proposed solution indeed solves the problem Almost all serious projects involved the above steps. That is why research skills such as problem formulation, review of related work and design of experiments to support your claims are important. In particular, formulating the right problem is often the key step towards a solution. To quote the words of Jiddu Krishnamurti , an Indian philosopher, \"If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it, because the answer is not separate from the problem\".","tags":"research","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/relevance-of-research-skills","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/relevance-of-research-skills"},{"title":"Bowling, Badminton and Buffet at Swiss Past Vs Present Games Day","text":"The second annual Swiss Cottage Past vs Present Games Day was held on the 5th September. Initially, I did not feel like attending the event as I could not get anyone from my class to come. The day before the games day, I received an SMS from William (one of alumni committee members from class of 75) asking all committee members to come down and support the games. I realized I shouldn't avoid the event just because no one else from my class is going, I should just go down and get to know the other alumni and current students. The bowling competition was held at CDANS, opposite Swiss Cottage. I was \"coerced\" into joining the game and was assigned to play alongside two new alumni. I figured they must be from Swiss Bowlers as they had their own carrying bags and bowling balls. We played a total of three games and my scores were: 104, 77, 83. I had lunch with a group of alumni at CDANS before walking back to Swiss Cottage for the afternoon games. Due to lack of players, Annie and I joined in the badminton game which was held in the school hall. Since both of us are not familiar with the game, needless to say we were completely trashed by the Swiss girls from the badminton club. A number of other games where held around Swiss, including basketball, floorball and soccer. In the end, the alumni won three out of the five games that were played that day. In retrospect, I am glad that I decided to go down for the games day as I really enjoyed myself playing the games. I also got to meet up with Mrs Ellie Koh and Mr Saiffudin, two teachers from when I was at Swiss but have since retired.","tags":"scss","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/bowling-badminton-and-buffet-at-swiss-past-vs-present-games-day","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/bowling-badminton-and-buffet-at-swiss-past-vs-present-games-day"},{"title":"Blogging from the command line","text":"This post is composed in the text editor Vim , using the L A T E X format and converted to HTML using H E V E A .

It has been a great week. The RECOMB Comparative Genomics Workshop was held from Monday to Wednesday. My talk was on the second day, it went smoothly but ended a little early. There was only one question, but after the talk a couple of people came and gave me some suggestions. On the same day as my talk, there was a dinner cruise on the river Seine and I got to meet some other folks during the dinner. All in all, it was a great conference as the topics discussed are closely related to my own work. The only problem I encountered was being unable to use my N82 to take pictures. Meddling with the settings and doing a reset did not help, in the end I had to buy 2 disposable cameras. After the conference ended on Wednesday, I visited Le Panth√©on. The most interesting part is the underground crypt, which houses the remains of distinguished citizens of France, including Marie Curie. Given the number of CRPG games with crypt levels, I was half expecting skeletons and zombies to jump out at me. After that, I went to Jardin du Luxembourg, the largest park in Paris. It was a refreshing change from the concrete jungle of the city. The first half of Thursday was spent visiting Prof Frej Tekaia. We had a good discussion on some research problems of mutual interest. After that, I went to see the Eiffel Tower, it looks a lot bigger up close as compared to when I saw it from afar during the dinner cruise. Finally on Friday, I visited the Louvre Museum and saw the Mona Lisa, among many other sculptors and paintings. Personally, I don't quite understand why the Mona Lisa is so famous. The last place I visited was the La Grande Galerie de l'Evolution (roughly translated as Grand Gallery of Evolution),I found it more fascinating than the Louvre.

I have to confess that I'm not a real biologist and my biology knowledge is fairly limited, but I have a healthy curiosity in new developments in biology. The diversity and complexity of life has always fascinated me. Computational biology is the application of computational techniques for tackling problems in biology. The problems can be broadly classified into two types. The first is to assist in the design/interpretation/analysis of high throughput experiments, such as micro arrays, tandem mass spectroscopy and DNA sequencing machines. The second is to discover meaningful patterns from biological data to improve our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. My own work in the comparative genomics of gene order is from the second category. The data I am considering is a set of gene orders, where a gene order is the sequence of genes that makes up the genome of a species. Although many species share a large number of genes, the arrangement of these genes are different due to large scale rearrangement events (see Figure 1 above) that has the effect of shuffling the genes around.","tags":"research","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/computational-biology","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/computational-biology"},{"title":"Music from YouTube","text":"These days I've been using YouTube as a music player.

It was a very simple web site written by hand using HTML and CSS. The purpose was to learn HTML but it also served as a page which I would put up mini reviews of freeware games/applications. The main page also contains a number of dated entries to indicate when the site was updated and some snippets of what I was doing in real life. The last entry which was dated August 9, 2000 was posted on National Day, see below. The next period in my web authoring experience was when I entered NUS in 2002. All SoC students are given a web site at http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~unix_user_name . It was far easier to setup a webpage than on my previous hosted service as I could upload the files to the server directly. I mainly used it to host a number of files, such as presentation slides etc. In 2005, I started a server for ACM/IOI training. The server hosted the Mooshak contest management system and a DokuWiki based website for the ACM/IOI community in NUS. The site grew over the years and over time I starting using the site to document my HYP project and to create web pages for courses I was teaching. After a while, the server began to show signs of instability. Intending to avoid the hassle of managing a physical server, I requested for a Solaris Zone account from the school, which is now the hosting the current algorithmics.comp.nus.edu.sg site.","tags":"web","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/websites","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/websites"},{"title":"SRG Day 2","text":"The three events held on the morning of the second day of the Singapore Robotic Games are: RC Sumo Micromouse Robot Soccer RC Sumo RC Sumo is almost the same as the autonomous sumo content, except that the robots are controlled by human handlers. Essentially two robots face off on a circular platform and the first robot to be pushed off the platform loses. The inclusion of the handlers makes the matches more exciting as sometimes the autonomous matches simply becomes a straight forward pushing contest. The handlers are typically less aggressive and tend to move about the platform more carefully. SRG's sumo competition is modeled after a contest in Japan, below is a video of the Japanese version. Micromouse Watching the micromouse competition brings back some fond memories of my secondary school days. I was in the Computer Club back then and we had a micromouse group. I was never directly involved with the micromouse teams, but watching an autonomous robot navigate a maze inspired me to think about how problem solving skills can be incorporated into a robot. Robot Soccer The highlight of the morning for me was the Robot Soccer Competition. It consists of two competing teams with 6 small cuboid robots each. The objective was to score but pushing a ping pong ball into the opposing team's goal, must like real soccer.The actions of the robots are controlled by a separate computer which is directly connected to a video feed of the top view of the entire playing area. An interesting trick was used to solve the problem of identification and localization of the robots. Each robot has a special colored logo on its top and this is analyzed by the image processing software on the controlling computer. This event is no doubt one of the more difficult ones, as only four teams were registered. The strengths of the teams also differs greatly, for the match I watched the final score was 10:0. Round up I didn't have time on Wednesday to attend the last day of the competition, but overall I felt that the SRG was a successful event in that it was able to attract a large number of teams from a variety of institutions from primary schools up to polytechnics and ITEs. Unfortunately due to the timing of the event, not many members of the public (like myself) was present. I guess only university students would be free during the period of the competition.","tags":"robotics","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/srg-day-2","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/srg-day-2"},{"title":"SRG Day 1","text":"I usually pass by the Science Center on my way to NUS. Today is the first day of the Singapore Robotic Games so I figured I will pop by and have a look and grab lunch at Jurong East before heading to school. There are three events being held this morning, namely: Underwater Robot Competition Autonomous Sumo Robot Competition Robot Colony Competition The Robot Colony Competition was the most interesting for me as it involves an interesting combination of hardware and software. In this event, teams must build a pair of autonomous robots that has to collect a number of pellets (blue and green) and deposit the correct colored pellet into a designated hole. There are two collection holes (one for each color) at two opposite corners of the playing field. The playing field is black except for reflective tape at the borders and collection holes. See the YouTube video below for an example. The robot hardware needs to be able to sense the colored pellets on a black featureless platform and have an effective mechanism to separate/store/deposit the two types of pellets. The software components needs to handle localization of the robot and coordination/information sharing between the two robots. Looking forward to the Robot Soccer Competition tomorrow.","tags":"robotics","url":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/srg-day-1","loc":"https://blog.melvinzhang.net/srg-day-1"}]};
